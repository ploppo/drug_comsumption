# Drug consumption dataset
In this work the aim is to analyse if there is a correlation between people and use of drugs, using different algorithm of machine learning such us LDA, MLP, SVM. PCA is considered but at the end is not used to perform feature reduction.
The research consider 12 attributes (personality measurements which include NEO-FFI-R (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness), BIS-11 (impulsivity), and ImpSS (sensation seeking), level of education, age, gender, country of residence and ethnicity) and 18 psychoactive substances, legal and illegal ones. 
For each drug people have to select one of the answers: never used the drug, used it over a decade ago, or in the last decade, year, month, week, or day.

The whole code is written in Python using the mostly library scikit-learn.
